### Required installed software:

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) v 6.10.0

### Quick start guide:

1. Clone the jestUnitTest repository on your computer
2. Open a console in `/JestUnitTest` directory
3. Invoke: `npm install -g jest`

### To Run Tests:
1. Open a console in the kata folder (ie. JestUnitTest)
2. Invoke: `npm test` to run the tests

You can put separate katas in folders, look at the "JestUnitTest" folder for an example.

Each folder needs a `package.json` file in order to run tests.
Its content is :

`{"scripts" : {"test": "jest"}}`
